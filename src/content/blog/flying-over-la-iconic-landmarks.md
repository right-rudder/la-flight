Flying in Los Angeles offers more than just top-tier flight instruction—it also comes with stunning views. At LA Flight Academy, students regularly experience the beauty of Southern California from above while building flight time and perfecting maneuvers. Here are five iconic landmarks you’re likely to fly over during your training at Van Nuys.

## 1. The Hollywood Sign

Visible from miles away, the Hollywood Sign is one of the most recognized symbols in the world. During your training flights, you’ll often pass by or near this legendary hillside landmark nestled in the Hollywood Hills.

## 2. Downtown LA Skyline

Flying past the skyscrapers of Downtown LA gives students a real sense of operating in complex airspace. It’s a perfect setting to sharpen your situational awareness and communication skills in a bustling metropolitan environment.

## 3. Santa Monica Pier

The colorful Ferris wheel and beach-lined coast of the Santa Monica Pier make it a favorite visual checkpoint for local pilots. Training flights along the coast offer breathtaking views and practical lessons in coastal navigation.

## 4. Malibu Coastline

The Malibu shoreline offers peaceful airspace and gorgeous scenery. It’s an excellent area for practicing maneuvers while enjoying views of cliffs, canyons, and luxury homes lining the Pacific Ocean.

## 5. Griffith Observatory

Another LA icon, the Griffith Observatory, sits atop Mount Hollywood and provides a picturesque frame for city views. Students flying in from the north or east often catch this landmark during arrival or departure routes.
