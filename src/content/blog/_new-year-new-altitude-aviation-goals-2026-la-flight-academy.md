## Start the Year Strong, Start It in the Sky

The new year is the perfect time to turn your dreams of flight into a plan of action. Whether you’re just beginning your aviation journey or looking to earn advanced ratings, LA Flight Academy can help you set meaningful goals, and achieve them.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Why

Before setting your goals, clarify your motivation. Do you want to fly for fun? Become an airline pilot? Teach others?  
Knowing your “why” helps determine your ideal training path, timeline, and budget.

---

## Step 2: Set Achievable Milestones

Breaking your larger goals into smaller steps keeps you motivated. For example:

- Earn your **Private Pilot License (PPL)** by summer.  
- Start your **Instrument Rating (IR)** by fall.  
- Log a specific number of hours each month.  

With structured guidance from your instructors, every milestone moves you closer to your dream cockpit.

## Step 3: Make It Measurable

Track your progress. Use your **pilot logbook**, simulator sessions, or training plan to visualize improvement. Progress you can see is progress that fuels consistency.

---

## Step 4: Stay Accountable

Work closely with your instructor and peers at LA Flight Academy. Our community provides encouragement, accountability, and advice that keeps your momentum strong, even when life gets busy.
